# Integrated Elibility and Enrollment in Vermont
Documentation describing the State of Vermont's Integrated Eligibility and Enrollment program

# Welcome!
This repo contains documentation describing the Vermont Agency of Health Services Integrated Eligibility and Enrollment modernization work. It is intended to be a place where project participants can keep track of the overall project goals, the decision framework, progress to date and learnings as we work. It is also intended to be a project 'home page' where members can access important and up-to-date project information that exists somewhere else.
